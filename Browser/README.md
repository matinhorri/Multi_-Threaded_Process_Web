CSCI 4061 Fall 2022 -> Project 2


The work was divided equally with each of us focused on certain parts. Everyone partook in group meetings and 
contributed significantly in the sucess of the project. While functions were worked by one or two people, everyone
convened and collaborated to understand code, issues, and debugging of the functions. 

  Functions created: 

    fav_ok() -
