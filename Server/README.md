CSCI 4061 Fall 2022 -> Project 3

The work was divided equally with each of us focused on certain parts. Everyone partook in group meetings and contributed significantly in the sucess of the project. While functions were worked by one or two people, everyone convened and collaborated to understand code, issues, and debugging of the functions.

Functions created:

initCache() - 
worker() - 
dispatcher() - 
addIntoCache() - 
readFromDisk() - 
deleteCache() - 
getContentType() - 
getCacheIndex() - 
main() - 

Caching Policy:

FIFO was selected as the caching policy as it was easier to theorize and implement in this context. As most of all haven't got a chance to implement a cache before in the past, FIFO served as a great learning point on implmentation of a cache compared to LRU/MRU e.t.c.
