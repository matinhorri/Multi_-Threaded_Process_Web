CSCI 4061 Fall 2022 -> Project 3

The work was divided equally with each of us focused on certain parts. Everyone partook in group meetings and contributed significantly in the sucess of the project. While functions were worked by one or two people, everyone convened and collaborated to understand code, issues, and debugging of the functions.

Functions created:

initCache() - worked on by Michael, and Matin
worker() - worked on by Matin, Michael, and Vaibhav
dispatcher() - worked on by Matin, Michael, and Vaibhav
addIntoCache() - worked on by Matin and Vaibhav
readFromDisk() - worked on by Matin and Michael
deleteCache() - worked on by Matin and Michael
getContentType() - worked on by Vaibhav
getCacheIndex() - worked on by Michael and Matin
main() - worked on by Michael, Vaibhav, and Matin

Caching Policy:

FIFO was selected as the caching policy as it was easier to theorize and implement in this context. As most of all haven't got a chance to implement a cache before in the past, FIFO served as a great learning point on implmentation of a cache compared to LRU/MRU e.t.c.
